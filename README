Project 5: Lamport and Vector Logical Clocks

1. Harrison Engel and Duy Dang

2. Operating Systems: Project Number 5
Language used: C++

3. This project is to simulate and test the two logical clock algorithms: Lamport and Vector so that students can really understand the algorithms.

4. There are currently no known issue with this submission. However, the input syntax will need to be exactly correct.

5. Approximately 14 hours were put into this project including reviewing the algorithms and the actual creation of code.

6. The biggest difficulty of this project is to deal with string manipulation in C++ to parse the messages.
